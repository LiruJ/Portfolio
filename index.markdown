Hi, I'm Laura, a software engineer from Erlangen, Germany.

I have an education and background in game development, but I have also freelanced for some time making online chat-bots and bespoke tooling for unique workflows.

I pick up whatever languages and frameworks are needed for the task, and quite enjoy the process of learning and discovering new things.

By now I do a little bit of everything. I have made dynamic websites using ASP.NET, this static website using Jekyll, multiple games in C# and C++, worked on a popular game in Lua, reverse engineered ARM9 programs with Ghidra, written backend server systems, and many other things that you can see in my projects below.
